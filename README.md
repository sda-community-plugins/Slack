# Micro Focus Deployment Automation - Slack plugin

The _Slack_ plugin allows you to send notifications to Slack as part of a Deployment Automation workflow.

This plugin is a work in progress but it is intended to provide the following steps:

* [x] **Post a Notification** - Send a notification to a Slack channel
* [x] **Post Attachment Notification to Slack** - Send an attachment notification to one or more Slack channels

### Installing the plugin
 
Download the latest version from the _release_ directory and install into Deployment Automation from the 
**Administration\Automation\Plugins** page.

### Building the plugin

To build the plugin you will need to clone the following repositories (at the same level as this repository):

 - [mavenBuildConfig](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/mavenBuildConfig)
 - [plugins-build-parent](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/plugins-build-parent)
 - [air-plugin-build-script](https://github.com/sda-community-plugins/air-plugin-build-script)
 
 and then compile using the following command
 ```
   mvn clean package
 ```  

This will create a _.zip_ file in the `target` directory when you can then install into Deployment Automation
from the **Administration\Automation\Plugins** page.

If you have any feedback or suggestions on this template then please contact me using the details below.
